# Sandbox Application

This is a sandbox application to test various Rails features, gems, interaction
with Web Services, etc. The `master` branch will always remain a "minimal"
application.

## Topics Researched

The following list is what were tested in this sandbox. Every branch/tag started
from the "minimal" application, and therefore each topic is completely
independent of each other.

1. Asset Pipeline
    1. Including External Libraries - tag `asset-pipeline`
2. i18n
    1. Form Helpers - tag `i18n`
